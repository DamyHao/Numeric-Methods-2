% From the results above it is clear that the system has three invariant 
% orbits. It seems like the trajectories tend to the external one if the 
% intial point is outside the small orbits, and it tends to the focus of 
% the small orbits if the intial point is inside. This makes us think that 
% the external one will be stable atractor and the other ones will be 
% unstable.

% For the x points -1,0,1 there are no results obatined, this
% result was expected as in section A we discovered that those points were
% equilibrium points.

% We will analize the stabilities in section C.

%% Section C
% Now we are looking for the stable and unstable equilibrium orbits
% mentioned in B.

% Following the guesses in section B about the orbit's stability, to obtain
% the unstables we will integrate backward in time and use intial guesses
% close to it that we will get form the plot in section B.
% To get the stable one we will integrate forward in time, and the intial
% guess can be any point outside the two unstabel orbits, as all
% trajectories that stat in that region will get to it, however we'll use a
% close one.

title('Period orbits and vectorial field')

% Using quiver and ploting the periodic orbits it is easy to see the
% stabiluties. The equilibrium points (-1,0) and (1,0) are stable and
% atractor as the velocity arrows of trajectories inside the red orbits
% point directly to them. So they 'get away' from the red orbits, which
% also do the ones startic outside the orbit, this tells us that those
% orbits are repulsor. Meanwhile for the points outside the red orbits all
% the velocity arrows point directly to the green curve, so this is an
% stable atractor orbit.

%% Section D

% Now let's see the stabilty of the origin. 
%From the plot of
% section B we know that it is unstable, as nothing goes to it, however is
% it repulor? More specifically it is a saddle point because it has a 
% positve and a negative real part eigenvalue. As a saddle point, it has 
% an invariant inestable vector (red) and a inverant stable vector (blue)
% passing through it.

% We compute the Jacobian of f at the point 0,0.
desiredPoints = 10000;

DF = jaco(@functionODE, [0; 0]);
[evec, eval] = eig(DF); % evec: matriu amb els vectors propis per columna, eval: matriu amb els valors propis a la diagonal
disp('The eigenvalues for the (0,0) point are')
disp(eig(DF))

% As the problem says, we see that the origin has a real positive
% eigenvalue and anotherone negative, so the origin is a saddle point. Now 
% if we plot the two invariant lines corresponding to the two eigenvalues
% we se how the system behaves near the point. We plot in blue the
% atractive one corresponding to the neagtive eigenvalue, and in red the
% repulsor one which is due to the positive eigenvalue.


% We start RK4 near the origin to see how the trajevctories evolve, and we
% use both the forward and backawrd integration.

% As expected when we integrate forward the trajectories tend to the stable

% Now focusing on the origin, we see how the trajectories approax the
